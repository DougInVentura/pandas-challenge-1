# Pandas-challenge-1
### Pandas challenge due Jan 8 2024

This exercise is in four parts.

#### Part 1: Exploring the data. 
Here we read in a csv file and perform dataframe operations to explore it.

#### Part 2: Transforming the data
Two client id's are compared to analyze the total spend (client 33615, who had the largest number of units purchased, versus client 66037.)
A series of subtotal columns are defined to account for shipping cost, tax, etc.

#### Part 3: Confirm your work.
Three order id's are provided and we were to find the total price across all the order line items.

#### Part 4: Summarize and Analyze
The top five clients by order quantity were found.
The total spend for each of these clients were found.  Then a top 5 (by quantity) dataframe was constructed to show total units, total shipping price, total revenue,
and total profit.  This was sorted (decending per the answer key) by total profit to have the higher profit clients at the top of the list.

Finally a final data frame was constructed that was formated for presentation, such as formating the currency entries in millions of $$$.
